# CS Academy Game

Originally made in CS Academy's Python Canvas environment.  
Might rebuild in standard Python using Pygame Zero to make it portable and open-source.

## Why
My old CS Academy account was deleted, but I saved the code. I wanted to recreate it to make it playable again outside of their platform.

## Tech
- Python 3
- Pygame Zero
